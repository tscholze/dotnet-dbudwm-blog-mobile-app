## What's dbudwm UWP app?
This app is an experiment of mine to work with the 'new' Microsoft Universal Platform ecosystem. 
This approach should allow to write an app once and deployed it to the desktop, tablet, phone, console and IoT devices. Sounds nice, ain't it?
for this example I focused exclusively on the smartphone.
